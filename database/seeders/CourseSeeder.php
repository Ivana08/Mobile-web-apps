                PHP programming and MySQL database.
                The course assumes that you know HTML and CSS, knowledge of JavaScript and jQuery is an advantage.
                PHP is a powerful object-oriented scripting language that works on the server side and is used to program dynamic web pages or web applications. PHP is one of the most widely used programming languages today. Without PHP, your website will still be static with the same data.
                In this programming course for complete beginners of PHP and MySQL, after setting up and introducing programming, you will go through the PHP language and make some practical examples. Watch a video from the course to learn more about backend languages and why it is good to learn how to program in PHP.',
